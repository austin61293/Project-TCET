# Project-TCET
Academic project for evaluating impact of hazardous waste product.

Our custom script tool aims to demonstrates impacted study areas from nuclear waste that allows the non-technical user who may or may not have technical understanding of GIS technology to use geospatial analysis to visualize hazardous waste permeation in their surrounding environment. Thus, we designed this ArcGIS custom script tool to provide knowledgeable visual information regarding past, present, and future costs to the environment, economy, and human wellness for public users.

Project Tool Primary Functionalities:
1) Land use impact assessment
2) Land cover prediction surface generation
3) Local hydrology delineation
